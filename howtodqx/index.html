    <h1>How to play Dragon Quest X</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome! This is a complete and step by step guide to set up and play 
        Dragon Quest X for people who don't understand Japanese 
        and/or live in a country where the ip ban is still active.
    </p>

    <p>
        Dragon Quest X only came in Japan, 
        and briefly in China before it was shut down, 
        but it was sadly never translated into English.
        Furthermore, if you live in one of the contries that are ip-blocked 
        you'll need to set up a VPN connection.
        As of today, the only countries without IP ban are:
        <ul>
            <li>Japan</li>
            <li>China</li>
            <li>The United States</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The purpose of this guide is to make an updated version of 
        <a href=https://www.woodus.com/forums/topic/28719-getting-started-on-pc>Cramberry's</a>,
        and make it more complete by explaining how to set up a VPN or play on
        other systems than PC.
        For more info you can check DDWEBSITE, PASTEBIN, DISCORD SERVER.
