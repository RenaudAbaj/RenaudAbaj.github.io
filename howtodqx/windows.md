## Updating the game

>If you live in a country where the IP ban is still on you don't need a VPN to update the game. In fact, you shouldn't be connected to a VPN when updating as it will make the downloading a lot slower.

Launch the game and let it update. It will take a lot of time, so be patient.

Once the game has finished updating click on "OK".

## Playing the game
