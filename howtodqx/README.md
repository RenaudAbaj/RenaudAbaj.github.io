# HEY JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THE SITE IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

# Introduction

Welcome! This is a complete and step by step guide to set up and play 
Dragon Quest X for people who don't understand Japanese 
and/or live in a country where the ip ban is still active.

Dragon Quest X only came in Japan, 
and briefly in China before it was shut down, 
but it was sadly never translated into English.
Furthermore, if you live in one of the contries that are ip-blocked 
you'll need to set up a VPN connection.
As of today, the only countries without IP ban are:
- Japan
- China
- The United States

The purpose of this guide is to make an updated version of 
[Cramberry's](https://www.woodus.com/forums/topic/28719-getting-started-on-pc),
and make it more complete and streamlined by explaining how to set up a VPN 
and play on other systems than PC.
For more info you can check the [Dragon's Den's forum](https://www.woodus.com/forums/forum/100-dragon-quest-x/) and the [DQX Gaijins](https://discord.gg/bVfnWF) where you can find other people to play with and other useful resources.

If you arleady know what you are doing you can quickly 
navigate using the menu on the left. Otherwise, you can
just follow the instructions starting from this page, everything you need to know will be explained.

For any remarks, corrections etc contact me on discord at renaud#5914 or directly make 
a pull request on the [Github repository](https://github.com/RenaudTGSTN/RenaudTGSTN.github.io).
