## Introduction

Welcome! This is a complete and step by step guide to set up and play 
Dragon Quest X for people who don't understand Japanese 
and/or live in a country where the ip ban is still active.

This guide only covers the free trial version setup. However, the free trial is unlimited in time, there are still things you cannot do in this version, for example you cannot go further than level 50 and you won't have access to all of the story's expansions. But you can play as long as you want without paying anything.

In the future, this guide may cover things such as paying
for a subscription or setting up other versions such as
the PS4 version.

Dragon Quest X only came in Japan, 
and briefly in China before it was shut down, 
but it was sadly never translated into English.
Furthermore, if you live in one of the contries that are ip-blocked 
you'll need to set up a VPN connection.
As of today, the only countries without IP ban are:
- Japan
- China
- The United States

The purpose of this guide is to make an updated version of 
[Ashes'](https://www.woodus.com/forums/topic/28719-getting-started-on-pc), to make it more streamlined, to help you play on switch and to help you set up a vpn connection.

## Next step

>/!\IMPORTANT/!\ Do not try one of the streaming versions (3DS, mobile, browser) before activating your trial for Windows, because it will prevent you from activating the trial for the Windows version. That being said, I don't recommand the streaming version at all, as it's not free, and it doesn't play well.
